# Encoding-Techniques
Encoding is required when you want to encode something. For example, suppose you have a particular column that has some strings or characters in it or maybe categories. These strings or rather these categories cannot be given to the machine-learning model  as we know the machine-learning model only accepts numbers. So in a dataset where there are strings, they have to be converted to numbers for the machine-learning model to work effectively. 

Taking you to the net level what am going to do in this notebook, will show us how to convert a particular string or category into a number and explore different techniques to do this. So there are a few techniques; one very generic way of doing it you can use mapping in Python for every particular category. Suppose you have a male or female, you can convert male or female to zero and one and you can embed these categories to a number and that will result in the solution that we can use as an input for the machine learning model.
